  The name of the file is tricky.

  The
  {% if true %}LICENSE{% endif %}.jinja2
  file name will be rendered as
  LICENSE.

  This would work with the same result so far if we just use the
  LICESE
  file name without any other tricks.

  However, in this case GitHub would automatically display the LICESE.jinja2 file in the repository licenses,
  but that is not for the current repo, "just" a template for future generated repos.

  So therefore. We get the same result, but we still change the file name in _this_ repository.
